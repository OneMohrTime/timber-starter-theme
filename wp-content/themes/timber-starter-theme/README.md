# OneMohrTime Timber Starter Theme

## Overview
This WordPress starter theme is built on top of Timber and DDEV to provide a robust and flexible foundation for creating modern, maintainable, and performant WordPress websites. It was written by [@onemohrtime](https://github.com/OneMohrTime), with a _**LOT**_ of inspiration and education from [@bgrrtt](https://github.com/bgrrtt).
